$ BaseCleR: An implementation of the ordered changes of Pardess (1990) as a DiaSim cascade
$
$ The goal of this base cascade is to be as faithful as possible to Pardess' description of the sound changes 
$ that occurred from Latin to Daco-Romanian.
$
$ When a formal rule is not well-suited for computerized application, we change it so that it works in DiaSim while
$ maintaining Pardess' intentions according to his rule title. This also applies for cases where Pardess made a 
$ minor mistake in the formal rule but his rule title and example lexica suggest his intentions.
$
$ Stages are included when a new chapter is reached in Pardess' rule list: ~Balkan Romance (R25), ~Common Romanian (R45)
$


$ Auxiliary rules necessary for Pardess' assumed Latin inputs -- From CLEF, from Pope (1934):

    $p102 s220 (also p73 s156i)  -- yod and w formation -- gliding of unstressed short non-low vowels before other vowels
        [+syl,-long,-stres,-lo] > [+hi,-syl,+tense] / __ [+syl]
